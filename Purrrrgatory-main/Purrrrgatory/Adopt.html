        <p>Most of the puppies,kittens and other baby animals that are sold in pet stores often originate from what are
          called- mills,which are made only for commercial purposes that focus on increasing profit with little regard
          for the health and welfare of the animals.Practices and conditions in most mills are unethical and downright
          repugnant in many cases.The animals are made to live in filthy conditions without adequate food, water or
          veterinary care.Female animals are bred at every opportunity with little to no recovery time between litters.
          Inbreeding is also a huge problem.Because of these conditions, mills often produce animals with serious health
          problems down the road and this translates to hefty vet bills for you. Many pet stores also don’t socialize
          their animals, which can lead to potential behavioral problems that aren’t ideal for a family pet. Adopting a
          pet, however, has a ton of advantages.
        <h3 style="border-bottom:2px dashed;width:25%;margin-right:875px;font-size:27px">Advantages of adopting</h3>
        <h4 style="margin-bottom:-10px;font-size:23px;width:25%;line-height:0%;">1.You will be saving a life!</h4><br>
        <p2 style="margin-top:0px;line-height:0px">Millions adoptable dogs and cats are euthanized each year because
          there are more people giving their pets to shelters than people adopting. By adopting a shelter pet, you are
          guaranteeing that at least one fewer adoptable animal will be euthanized this year due to lack of space. Not
          only is this great news for the pet you adopt, but it’s also very personally rewarding to know that your pet
          is alive and happy because of your decision.</p2><br>

          style="float:right;width:150px;height:125px;margin-right:20px;margin-left:20px;border:4px solid coral">
        <h5 style="margin-bottom:0px;font-size: 23px">2.Most shelter animals are already house -trained!<br></h5>
        <p3>Because so many shelter animals have previously lived in homes, there’s a good chance you’ll be able to find
          a pet that’s already house trained and knows how to be on their best behavior. This is great news for owners
          who don’t have a lot of experience training pets or much time to devote to house training.</p3><br>
        <h6 style="margin-bottom:0px;font-size:23px"> 3.You will indirectly NOT be supporting animal cruelty!<br></h5>
          <p4>You choosing to adopt instead of buying results in lesser money for mills.If a huge amount of pets are
            adopted,this could help us in bringing down the exploitative mills</p4><br>
          <img src="Images/adopt3.jpg"
            style="width:150px;height:125px;margin-right:20px;margin-left:20px;border :4px solid yellow;float:left;margin-top:40px">
          <h6 style="margin-bottom:-10px;font-size:23px;line-height:0px"> 4.You will save money</h6><br>
          <p5>Although adopting a shelter pet isn’t free, you get more for what you pay for than if you buy say a dog
            from a pet store or an online seller. In most cases, pets who come from shelters have been given their
            shots, were previously spayed or neutered, and have had microchips inserted in case the dog happens to get
            lost. You’ll probably at most pay around a few thousand rupees(or even lesser) to adopt a dog from a
            shelter, including the cost of both the dog and all of these treatments. Compare that to the money required
            to purchase a dog, as well as paying for all of the treatments on top of that, and it’s clear which is the
            most economical choice.
          </p5><br>
          <h6 style="margin-bottom:-10px;font-size:23px;line-height:0px"> 5.You Won’t Support Puppy Mills</h6><br>
          <p5>Some pet stores and online retailers sell dogs that were bred in puppy mills, despite the terrible
            conditions both the breeding dogs and their puppies are kept in. The puppies that are bred into puppy mills
            are housed in cramped, unsanitary conditions that lead to disease and behavioral issues. Some puppies that
            come from mills are afraid of humans or other dogs, and can even develop extreme aggression, which you
            wouldn’t know without meeting the dog first.</p5><br>

            style="float:right; width:150px;height:125px;border:4px solid green;margin-left:20px;margin-right:20px">
          <h6 style="margin-bottom:-10px;font-size:23px;line-height:0px"> 6.You can choose a pet of any age</h6><br>
          <p5>Although puppies and kittens are cute, they can require a lot of work to train. An adult or older pet that
            is already trained may be a better fit for your lifestyle. For example, adopting an adult dog that is
            already housetrained and knows basic commands is often much easier than adopting a puppy.</p5><br>
          <h6 style="margin-bottom:-10px;font-size:23px;line-height:0px">7.You will have a support system offered by the
            organisation</h6><br>
          <p5>Rescue groups often provide support for new owners because keeping pets in good homes is in the best
            interest of these groups. So if you are worried about health issues, want advice on what kind of dog food to
            buy, or have other newbie questions, the shelter staff will probably have opinions and advice to share.</p5>

          <h6 style="margin-bottom:15px;font-size:23px;line-height:0px"> 8.Your adoption donation helps animals</h6>
          <p5>Rehoming centres are by their very nature, 'non-profit' organisations. The adoption fee (donation) you pay
            when you adopt goes towards helping the animals (neutering, vaccinations, vet bills, food, litter, bedding
            etc) and not to line someone’s pocket.</p5><br>
