            The first thing you should consider is whether you will be able to handle having a vocal cat. Some cat breeds can actually be quite noisy.<br>
            
            
            While most cat owners do not have a problem with these vocal breeds, as they realize their cats are just communicating with them, a loud cat can be a problem in an apartment situation. Breeds that are very vocal are the Siamese Cat, the Korat, and the Burmese. The Scottish Fold, Somali, and the American Curl are considered to be very quiet cat breeds.<br>
            
            Next, you will want to think about whether you want a cat who is cuddly or if a more aloof breed is right for you. If you do not have a lot of free time, a cuddly cat who loves attention may be the wrong choice. However, affectionate cats are usually better with children than more reserved breeds.<br>
            
            Some of the friendliest cat breeds are the Snowshoe, Abyssinian, Maine Coon, Ragdoll, Tonkinese, and the Himalayan Persian. Less sociable breeds are the Norwegian Forest Cat, the Nebelung, and the Russian Shorthair.<br><br>
            
            If you are looking for a cat who can amuse himself and will not get into constant mischief, then the Sphynx, Siamese, Rex, Balinese, and British Angora breeds may be a bad choice. These cats are very inquisitive and energetic. However, for someone who is homebound or has a lot of free time, these cats are a wonderful source of entertainment. In fact, the Rex is downright silly in his attempts to amuse those around him.<br><br>
            
            Of course, while you are looking at what cat breed to shop for, don’t get so caught up in selecting the right temperament that you overlook other important features. One of the most important things to consider when you are looking for the right cat is whether you want a long haired or short haired breed.<br><br>
            
            People who don’t have a lot of time to devote to a pet may want to opt for a short haired breed. Although that fuzzy ball of fluff may look adorable right now, grooming adult long haired cats can take up quite a lot of time. If you neglect your cat’s coat, it can tangle and matt up at an alarmingly fast rate, right down to his skin. Once this happens, your only option is to have him shaved completely, which can be quite traumatic. Also, your cat will probably have to be sedated before he can be shaved down, which poses a health risk.<br><br>
            
            Once you consider all of the different features and traits for the cat breeds you are interested in, you will finally be ready to start searching for your new pet. Now, you will need to decide whether you want a kitten or if you would prefer to give an abandoned older cat a second chance. If you are looking for a certain breed of kitten, check out your local cat show, since most exhibitors have a few kittens for sale. If an older cat is right for you, give your local humane society or animal rescue a cat.<br><br>- source:felineonline.com
          
        <h3 style="border-bottom:2px dashed;margin-right:900px">Most popular cat breeds</h3>
        
        <h4 style="margin-bottom:-10px;font-size:19px;line-height:0px">1.Siamese</h4><br>
        
        <p2 style="margin-top:0px;line-height:0px">Popular since the 19th century, this breed of cat originated in Thailand (formerly known as Siam). The Siamese has helped create many other breeds, including the Oriental Shorthair, Sphynx, and Himalayan.

            Siamese cats have distinct markings called "points" that are the areas of coloration on their face, ears, feet, and tail, but some Siamese may not have any points. There are also two varieties of Siamese cats, one with an "apple" shaped head and chubbier body and one with a larger head and slender body.
            
            The animated Disney film, "Lady and the Tramp," featured Siamese cats singing a song and demonstrating not only their intelligence but also how vocal they can be.
            
            Many Siamese cats that were originally from Thailand had a kink in their tail. This trait was bred out of most Siamese, but you'll still find it in Siamese street cats in Thailand.</p2><br>

          style="float:right;width:150px;height:125px;margin-right:20px;margin-left:20px;border:4px solid coral;margin-top:50px">
        
        <h5 style="margin-bottom:0px;font-size:19px">2.Persian<br></h5>
        
        <p3>Also lovingly referred to as one of the "smushed-face" cats, Persians have beautiful, long, fur coats. They can come in almost any color, depending on which cat registry association you are looking at, and have a flat face when compared to most other breeds of cats. Some breed descriptions even state the nose is not allowed to protrude past the eyes when viewed in a profile.

            Persians have been seen in many movies, art, commercials, and homes throughout the years and have also been one of the most popular breeds of cats for decades.
            
            Their coats demand regular grooming, otherwise, matting will result. Like many purebreds, they are prone to a variety of diseases, including renal and cardiac problems.
            
            Persians are also known as the Persian Longhair, the Iranian cat, and the Shirazi cat, named after the city of Shiraz, Iran, since they were originally imported from Iran.</p3><br>
        <h6 style="margin-bottom:0px;font-size:19px"> 3.Maine Coon<br></h5>
          <p4>Known for their large stature and thick fur coats, the Maine Coon is a cat that is difficult to ignore. Hailing from the state of Maine and the state’s official cat, the Maine Coon is a gentle giant. They are great hunters and were popularized after the CFA recognized them as a purebred in the late 1970s. They remain one of the most popular cat breeds.

            Many Maine Coons have extra toes, a trait referred to as polydactylism, which makes their already large feet even larger. This is a great feature to have when hunting in the snow since large feet act as snowshoes.
            
            The classic Maine Coon coloration is a brown tabby, but this breed can come in almost any color.</p4><br>
        
          <img src="ragdoll.jpg"
            style="width:150px;height:125px;margin-right:20px;margin-left:20px;border :4px solid yellow;float:left;margin-top:37px;margin-bottom:20px">
        
          <h6 style="margin-bottom:-10px;font-size:19px;line-height:0px"> 4.Ragdoll</h6><br>
        
          <p5>Ragdoll cats get their name from their docile temperament. They seem to go limp when picked up, much like a rag doll. At one time, it was even thought that they couldn’t feel pain, but that is of course only a myth.

            Ragdolls look a lot like long-haired Siamese cats with their pointed color patterns. They also have distinctive blue eyes and dog-like personalities, following their owners around the house.
          </p5><br>
          <h6 style="margin-bottom:-10px;font-size:19px;line-height:0px"> 5.Birman</h6><br>
        
          <p5>Birmans are another color-pointed cat like the Siamese and Ragdoll. They have blue eyes and a medium-long coat but no undercoat, setting them apart from Persians and Himalayans.

            Birmans were used for breeding in the development of Ragdolls, so they look very similar but can have slightly different markings and personalities.</p5><br>
          <img src="bengal.jpg"
           style="float:right; width:150px;height:125px;border:4px solid green;margin-left:20px;margin-right:20px;margin-top:60px">
        
          <h6 style="margin-bottom:-10px;font-size:19px;line-height:0px"> 6.Bengal</h6><br>
        
          <p5>Bengals are wild looking cats—literally. Their markings make them look more like they belong in the jungle than in your home, but they are domesticated cats nonetheless. They are talkative and require a lot of exercise.

            Many colors are allowed on Bengals, but their approved patterns only include spots and rosettes. Their name comes from the Asian leopard cat’s taxonomic name, Prionailurus bengalensis bengalensis, since Bengals were originally bred from both domestic cats and this wildcat. They get their beautiful patterns from this wildcat as well.</p5><br>
        
          <h6 style="margin-bottom:-10px;font-size:19px;line-height:0px">7.Abyssinian</h6><br>
        
          <p5>Originally from Ethiopia (previously known as Abyssinia), the Abyssinian cat has a distinctive red/orange agouti coat. The agouti fur, which actually means it has bands of light and dark coloring on the individual pieces of hair, gives the Abyssinian its unique look.

            In addition to the most common color referred to as ruddy, Abyssinians can also come in cinnamon, fawn, and blue.</p5>

          <h6 style="margin-bottom:15px;font-size:19px;line-height:0px"> 8.Oriental Shorthair</h6>
        
          <p5>At a glance, you may think this slender cat is a Siamese, but Oriental Shorthair cats are a breed all their own. Unlike Siamese cats, they usually have green eyes and can come in many color patterns and colors. A longhair variety also exists.

            Oriental Shorthair cats are prone to skin cancer and getting cold due to their lack of fur, so they are often seen wearing sweaters.<br><br><br>Source:Thesprucepets</p5><br>
